# Tableau_Demo
An example of some of my Data Visualization skills via Tableau based on the assignments I was given during my Google Professional Data Analytics Certificate. This was performed using the World Happiness Open Source Data Sets https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318923/world-poll-public-datasets.aspx. This is the link to the work on Tableu and a copy of the presentation I made in Canva using the heatmaps and scattergraphs I made with Tableau.
